# otio-wasm
OpenTimelineIO SVG renderer in your browser.

This repository is an experiment to get [OpenTimelineIO](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Opentimelineio)
in a web page using WebAssembly.

It's using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html) to compile a WebAssembly wheel that can then be
imported frmo javascript using Pyodide.

You can try it at https://jcmorin.dev/otio-wasm/.
